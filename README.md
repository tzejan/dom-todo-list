# DOM Manipulation Lab: Todo List

Instructions:
1. fork repo
2. clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/dom-todo-list`
3. `cd` into directory and run `open index.html` to open the page on a browser
4. complete the following tasks
	- [ ] Link your css and javascript to your HTML page (test that it works with a `console.log` and some css style)
	- [ ] For each todo in the tasks array, append it to the `<ul id='todo-list'></ul>` element
 	- [ ] Create a css class (e.g. `.done`) that, when applied on an element, adds the `text-decoration: line-through` property
 	- [ ] Add a click listener to the `<li></li>` elements and a callback function that adds the css class that you created in the previous step
 	- [ ] Update the callback function so that clicking on the list element toggles (i.e. add/remove) the `.done` css class
 	- [ ] Add a `<input>` HTML element and a `<button>Add Todo</button>` HTML element that displays the user's input as part of the todo list when the button is clicked
 	- [ ] Add css styling and make this a nice todo list that you can show off!
	- [ ] Bonus: Allow user to create a todo when s/he presses the 'Enter' key

Bonus:
- when you are tired of refreshing your browser with every change, you can install this vscode plugin to do auto reload: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
